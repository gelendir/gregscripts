As the saying goes "If you want somthing done, then do it yourself".

This is a collection of various small python scripts that i've programmed/hacked
for whenever I needed a script for getting something done but I couldn't find anything
to my liking. At the top of each file you will find a description of what the script does.

Please feel free to fork/contribute to these scripts !
